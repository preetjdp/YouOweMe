OR

- Ask one of the contributors to add your SHA-1 Key to the Firebase Console.

- Run the app.

```bash
flutter run
```

### Startup

YouOweMe uses [Device Preview](https://pub.dev/packages/device_preview) to
build and to visualise how the app will look
on different devices.

On First Debug Run you will find a such a layout:

This applicaiton used Artemis for graphql code generation.

To update the schema get the latest form the [API](https://youoweme-6c622.appspot.com/),
and update the file located at `lib/resources/graphql/youoweme.schema.graphql`

### Code Generator For Artemis.

When you update / add a new GraphQl Query run this to generate dart
types

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

### Run Import Sorter

```bash
flutter pub run import_sorter:main
```

### Add New Queries / Mutation / Subscriptions

Add them to their respective folders under

`lib/resources/graphql/`

### Add missing files in code.

Run this very carefully so it does not mess up some
OS level configuration.

```bash
flutter create . --org dev.preetjdp youoweme
```

### How to update the icon

```bash
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
```

### KeyTool options

`Password => q^iB07QT`

### Get Sha Key from key.jks

```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore {filePath} -alias {key-alias}
Example:
keytool -list -v -keystore ./android/app/key.jks -alias key

# Location for Debug Key in Windows
# C:\Users\Dell\.android
```

### Generate New Sha Key

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore key.jks -storetype JKS -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias key

# https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android
```

### Launch url on the phone.

```bash
